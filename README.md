# TSL2561 - Light Sensor

A sensor which detect someone's presence in the room to turn ON/OFF atuomatic light system.

# Purpose:

Most of the energy gets wasted due to inproper handling i.e. leaving lights open when no ones is there. Also most of the outdoor and street lights are manually operated using light sensors we can put them on auto switch using light sensors which can save power.

# Component Requirements:

In order to build this project these are the essential components that you need:

- [x] Raspberry pi
- [x] TSL2561 Lux/Light Sensor
- [x] Jumper wires and breadboard to test out temporary circuit 
- [x] PCB board with final circuit printed on it with correct <b>address</b>
- [x] Socket Header to attach sensor and pi together on PCB
- [x] Case to hold ciruit together and prevent it from damage  

## Overall Budget will be approxmately as below:

For me most of the components were provided by Humber College it costed me around $155

## Time Commitment 

Before we start it is important to make a schedule to keep us on track that will help us to check if everything is going as planed. 
Keep on checking if there were any delays and try to work accordingly.

- Setup raspberry pi

Once you have got your raspberry pi start working on its functionality download required operating System and allow all the permissions required. if you're first time installing os on raspberry pi and don't know how to do it follow: these setps:

**Setting up Raspberry Pi**
After receiving the order, the first step is installing Raspian on Raspberry Pi.These are the steps for installation as given below:-

### Step 1: Download Raspbian
It can easily take more than half an hour to download the software.Download Noobs from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/ 

### Step 2: Unzip the file
The Raspbian disc image is compressed, so you’ll need to unzip it. The file uses the ZIP64 format, so depending on how current your built-in utilities are, you need to use certain programs to unzip it.

#### Step 3: Write the disc image to your microSD card
Select the drive of your SD card in the ‘Device’ dropdown.

#### Step 4: Put the microSD card in your Pi and boot up
Select ‘Write’ and wait for the process to finish which may take around 20 minutes to complete.
